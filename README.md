# Brainfuck2 Translator project
This repo contains code and information about our extended version of
Brainfuck programing language (Bf2). You can find grammar of the language
and the code allowing to translate it into executable C code.
We've also provided a GUI to make everything easier.
To run it just use this command (within the brainfuck2Logic folder):
 - **python main.py** </br>

The GUI also allows user to create a colored HTML file based on a C file,
but this is just a fun feature that we've added.
Enjoy!!!
